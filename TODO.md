# TODO List

## Certainly

- Manual implementation of blacklisted commands
- More instances for argument type classes
- Add Redis* instances for
    - containers
    - unordered-containers
    - vector
- SETBIT argument types: Bool or Int for the bit argument.
- AUTH when connecting


## Maybe

- Can RedisHash be implemented in term of RedisPair?
- use pool library by bos for connection pooling
