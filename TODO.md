# TODO List

## Certainly

- Benchmark
    - include pathological cases with a lot of list appending when building reqs
- Test to check if pipelining works
- Command renaming, perhaps additional param (Map CmdName CmdName) for connect?

## Maybe

- clean up GenCmds.hs
    - use Text.Lazy.Builder?
- AUTH when connecting (User can do this easily, right after connecting)
